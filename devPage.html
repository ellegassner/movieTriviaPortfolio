                <p>My most important skill is that I am eager to learn and highly motivated, but over my years as a civil engineer, I
                developed a set of skills that are also applied in the IT industry and
                allows me to perform as a team player, to be more efficient, proactive, committed, reliable, time and
                goal-oriented, logical, as well as experienced in planning, cost control, business and system analysis. I also work as a
                project manager during the Rio Olympics Games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, I do have excellent analytical and critical thinking skills applied knowledge on talking to clients and end-users.
                I am an effective communicator with excellent verbal and written communication skills
                including Portuguese and English and experience as a group leader.</p>

                <p>Bringing people together, making them feel supported & included is a big motivator for me in all aspects of my life. I
                know great communication can lead to major successes in all projects; which is why it's in the forefront of everything I
                do.
                <br>
                <br>
                With my diverse background, I have developed skills as a confident self-starter, excellent attention to detail, and the
                ability to solve complex problems and to adapt to changing environments. These abilities have enabled me to progress
                with web-development quickly and will further ensure success as I move towards my goal of creating dry, responsive, and
                accessible code.</p>
