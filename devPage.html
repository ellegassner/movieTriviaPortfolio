                    with high honours and Juno College of Technology. Eager to learn and highly motivated. My proven
                    skills, knowledge, and
                    abilities in programming, debugging, and testing web or desktop-based application, makes me

                    My engineer background and my education have trained me to perform as a team player, an excellent
                    communicator both in
                    English and Portuguese,
                    reliable, proactive, effective team player, efficient, committed, time and goal-oriented and
                    excellent analytical and critical thinker.

                <p>Bringing people together, making them feel supported & included is a big motivator for me in all
                    aspects of my life. I
                    know great communication can lead to major successes in all projects; which is why it's in the
                    forefront of everything I
                    do.

                    <br>
                    With my diverse background, I have developed skills as a confident self-starter, excellent attention
                    to detail, and the
                    ability to solve complex problems and to adapt to changing environments. These abilities have
                    enabled me to progress
                    with web-development quickly and will further ensure success as I move towards my goal of creating
                    dry, responsive, and
                    accessible code.
